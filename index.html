        <h2>better notifications</h2>
        <p>
            Notifications for mobile devices are way too complicated to get to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is APN for iOS devices and GCM for Android devices&mdash;that means supporting two separate stacks just to send the same notification.
            GCM for iOS is the new kid on the block, but it doesn't really solve any problems: the interface for sending a notification to iOS is still different from sending one to Android.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notifications are anything <em>but</em> client agnostic.
            But that's not the only problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the client-side the code to <em>receive notifications</em> is insanely complicated.
            Oh, you can figure it out&mdash;but should you really have to set up three different services and blindly copy-paste some code from a tutorial to get to receive your first notification?
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no low-barrier-of-entry way to receive notifications.
            There is no simple on-notification-do-this abstraction.

        <h1>Unified Interface</h1>
        <h2>client-agnostic</h2>
        <p>
            First step is building an interface for notifications that works no matter the client.
            Send one request, any number of recipients, and it <em>just works</em>.

        <h2>abstract away internals</h2>
        <p>
            What is a registration id?
            A token?
            A notification key?
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you actually care, or do you just want to <em>receive notifications</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
            I bet you don't care.
            This project will abstract away all of the internal keys used, and let you identify users by the handles you <em>already use</em> in your system.

        <h1>Client Libraries</h1>
        <h2>less than 4 concepts</h2>
        <p>
            The client-side code for <em>receiving</em> notifications is needlessly complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project will provide neat abstractions for easily registering and updating registration IDs and listening to notifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being able to do this with less than 4 abstractions, and hopefully without always-identical configuration code would be top notch.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project should support <em>at least</em> Android and iOS.
